When you make a request like localhost:8000/sharebooks/home/viewBook  and you are expecting a jsp(view/books/jsp/viewBook.jsp)  in return, the path localhost:8000/sharebooks/home/  will be appended to the path of jsp. 
The requested jsp will be localhost:8000/sharebooks/home/view/books/jsp/viewBook.jsp and not localhost:8000/sharebooks/view/books/jsp/viewBook.jsp

So construct your requests carefully

Tomcat stores the session id even when it is closed and you can resume your session when the tomcat is switched on
